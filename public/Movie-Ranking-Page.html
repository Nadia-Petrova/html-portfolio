<h1>Best childhood movies according to Nadia</h1>
<h2>The Top 3 movies that define my childhood</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Swan Princess</h3>
<p>
  This is a childhood favourite that holds a special place in my heart. One of
  the last entirely hand-drawn animations
</p>
<h3>Harry Potter 1-8</h3>
<p>
  I've cheated a little bit as these are 8 movies, istead of one. You can't
  separate them, though.
</p>
<h3>Lion King 3</h3>
<p>A cult classic. Reminds me of fun summer days with my cousins</p>
